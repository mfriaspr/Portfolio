        <h1 class="text_section">About the Project</h1>
        <p class="text_section">LinkUp, a web service for universities, streamlines group formation for students. It combines project portfolios, relevant coursework, and availability to help students find compatible partners. LinkUp arose from the need to address the challenges of finding groups for online classes during COVID-19. However, the need still exists for in-person project-based classes. Students often post across various forums to find groups, a disorganized and time-consuming process. LinkUp offers a simpler, faster solution.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">Background </h3>
        <p class="text_section">Collaborative work is a fundamental component of university courses, as it drives students to utilize their collective skill sets to accomplish a wide range of tasks beyond their capabilities as individuals. Despite the abundant benefits of learning from one’s peers, it is not always the case that all members of a team are compatible with one another. When a group is unable to function at its fullest, productivity and efficiency can be hindered along with various issues which might arise within the team. This issue is central to our project’s design, as our goal is to alleviate compatibility problems within teams by offering a comprehensive group-finding process to prevent future issues from occurring. Professors and students understand the lengthy group-finding process delays starting a quarter. Without knowing group members' skills and preferences, mismatched and inefficient groups can form. To develop LinkUp, we primarily interviewed students about their group-finding experiences. We identified key features for this web service based on user needs. We re-interviewed students for feedback on the design and built a prototype before developing a high-fidelity prototype that aligned with the user feedback.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="text_section">Students and professors alike understand the lengthy process of forming groups at the start of each quarter, and how it has the potential to waste valuable time. It is in the best interest of all involved to have a speedy method of accomplishing this task, without hindering the quality of the groups themselves. An issue we identified through our need-finding was that students struggled to gain adequate knowledge to judge if an individual was a proper fit for their team. Important factors students consider include project portfolios, schedules, anecdotal ratings from prior group members, and general work ethics/preferences of a prospective member. After discussing group finding experiences with university students, we identified that the current means of constructing teams often lack these key factors, leading to the formation of groups with compatibility problems. Currently, the majority of students result in posting messages on Canvas discussion pages or unofficial course Discord servers to identify potential members. This approach is flawed as without a proper biography of the individual, it is difficult to determine whether or not they are an adequate fit for one’s team.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">The Solution</h3>
        <p class="text_section">Our approach to this problem was to develop a central service linked to the university, which would allow students to have a continuing profile throughout their studies. At the start of each quarter, all students enrolled in a course would be added to our service and would be visible to their peers. Each individual would have an in-depth profile viewable by the class that students could utilize to learn more about potential group members. Students would be assigned a compatibility rating based on the factors that were described above, and similar profiles would be suggested to one another as a potential fit. Once students can see the preferences and academic histories of their peers, they will be able to make an informed decision about who to include in their groups, leading to a compatible and efficient team.</p>

        <h1 class="text_section">Research</h1>
        <p class="text_section">To understand the issues students were having with forming groups on a deeper level, we developed an open-ended survey that allowed us to gauge what students were looking for in a project like this. This helped us refine the focus of our project. To a total of 12 students, we asked the following six questions. </p>
        <ul class="text_section" style="margin-left: 17%; margin-right: 17%;">
            <li>What's your experience with finding groups for academic projects?</li>
            <li>By what means do you usually find groups?</li>
            <li>What in your opinion would make finding groups for courses easier?</li>
            <li>If there was a better platform for group finding, what design solutions would you suggest be incorporated? Do you believe such a service would be useful?</li>
            <li>What could be a potential downside of having this type of platform accessible to one’s peers?</li>
            <li>Is there any additional insight you’d like to add?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text_section">Findings</h3>
        <p class="text_section">From these six questions, we were able to gain information on why a project such as “Link Up” is necessary. 11 of the 12 students said they had trouble with finding groups for projects. 9 of the 12 students said they would be willing to use an alternate resource such as a website or an app, if it meant finding groups for projects would be easier. Various students provided specific details they would like to see incorporated into a project like this. These included features such as student profiles, project listings, and real-time communication tools. With this information, we reconfirmed the need for a resource that helps students find partners for groups and set out to start developing one. We aimed to develop a platform that allows students to connect and find partners that are best suited for them.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">Personas</h3>
        <p class="text_section">To design our web service, we knew that the primary goal was to enable users to easily find others to group with. To get a detailed understanding of how to accomplish this, we interviewed 12 students to identify their pain points and needs when looking for groups. These interviews served as our need-finding process, and we identified that there were common themes for students that came up during the group-finding period, such as conflicting/restricting schedules, imbalance of expertise/work ethic, and social anxiety towards approaching strangers. We considered these themes when designing our web service, and focused on making a system that gave users all the necessary information they would need to identify compatible teammates.</p>

        <h1 class="text_section">Low Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
        <p class="text_section">The first iteration we created had a bright blue and white color scheme. Based on the feedback from interviews, it resembled a lot like a social media website, specifically LinkedIn. The first draft had some features that did not seem appropriate for its intended purpose. For example, there was a “like'' and “repost” button that was not useful for students viewing the feed posts on the homepage. Additionally, we received feedback that the color scheme was too bright and distracting to the user. After consideration of all feedback from students, we removed the “like” and “repost” buttons and added a “connect” button which would serve as the main way students can interact and add each other to groups. We also redesigned the logo to fit new branding guidelines. We made the logo black and white to create a minimal and sleek design; this solved the issue of it being too distracting.</p>

        <img src="images\linkup_draft1.png" alt="linkup low fidelity wireframe 1" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 10px; margin-left: auto;">
        <img src="images\linkup_draft1.2.png" alt="linkup low fidelity wireframe 2" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 10px; margin-left: auto;">
        
        <h1 class="text_section">High Fidelity Prototypes</h1>
        <p class="text_section">Our final iteration displays the color scheme and layout we ended up going with. On the homepage, we were able to evenly lay out the feed posts and recommended student cards without having too much white space. We improved the compatibility display score that would change color according to its percentage. When a user was to click on “My Profile” it should display a menu of “About Me”, “Experience” and “Schedule”. The About Me page displays a quick biography, groups already made, classes being taken, and any recent anonymous reviews from other students. The Experience page shows all past work experience along with any projects. The Schedule page is mainly used to view availability. This comes in handy when planning to meet up with a group to study. A feature we would like to implement is automatically having Google Calendar sync a user’s availability.</p>

        </div>

        <h1 class="text_section">Improvements</h1>
        <p class="text_section">We plan to conduct further user interviews and surveys to gain additional insights into how LinkUp can better meet users' needs. In particular, we aim to interview users from a wider range of demographic backgrounds, majors, and academic years. We will analyze the feedback from these interviews to identify key areas for improvement in the user experience, interface design, and functionality of LinkUp. We intend to perform beta testing of LinkUp with these larger sets of users. The beta testing program will allow us to observe how users interact with LinkUp in real-world networking scenarios. We will gather both quantitative and qualitative feedback from the beta testers which will be invaluable in enhancing the product before a broader rollout. Additionally, we plan to incorporate a group messaging system, as aforementioned, directly into the LinkUp platform so that users can easily communicate and coordinate with one another without relying on third-party messaging services. This important feature will strengthen the networking capabilities of LinkUp and provide further value to users. Overall, we remain focused on refining LinkUp to optimize the value it provides to users. We aim to build on our progress to date by incorporating the voices of more users (university and even high-school students) into the continued development of this web-based service. Additional user input and a group messaging system will certainly help ensure that LinkUp meets the needs of users and shapes the future of networking technology within classrooms.</p>
