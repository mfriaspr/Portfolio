        <h1 class="text_section">Overview</h1>
        <p class="text_section">The emergence of COVID affected students mentally, emotionally, and physically. Communities were constantly worried about loved ones and 
            their own health. As a result, a lot of companies and schools went remote. As a first year college student at that time, it made it increasingly harder to make 
            friends over Zoom. Fluffle is an app that was created to aid students connect with each other based on their current classes, majors, and likings. 
            This was an idea created during the University of California, Davis Hackaton in 2022 in a spam of 24 hours.</p>
        <p class="text_section">When registering for the Hackaton in Davis, CA our team did not know what project we would would on for the allocated 24 hours. 
            The team was made up of one electrical engineer, two computer science majors, and one design major. Our approach was to look at problems we encountered as 
            suddens right after coming in person from Zoom classes. 
            We all agreed it was insanely difficult to make friends as first generation students struggling to navigate campus and also network with students.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">Problem</h3>
        <p class="text_section">The issue is that all students in 2021 were transitioning from having Zoom classes to in person classes so if you were a first or 
            second year, you did not receive the chance to make friends in person. Zoom classes were awkward and even the participation in breakout rooms were very minimal.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">Solution</h3>
        <p class="text_section">Our team created the idea of making an app that connected students according to their major, classes, and interests. 
            It would serve as a social app for students to network and find their niche in school.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="text_section">Research</h1>
        <p class="text_section">In order to start this project, our team needed to research other competitors who may have already be taking the same approach. 
            We also needed to identify the main concerns and challenges students faced. In order to do this, and due to the limited of time given, we shared a user 
            survey to friends and other students who were able to submit the survey quickly. </p>
        <h3 class="text_section">Findings</h3>
        <ol class="text_section">
            <li>Students felt anxious creating new friendships in person and did not know how to approach other students.</li>
            <li>Students wanted to meet other students based on major and hobbies rather than an at random approach.</li>
            <li>Students preferred an app based product rather than a website. They find it easier to use on the go.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="text_section">Personas</h3>
        <p class="text_section">Our targeted audience was mainly UC Davis students, we tried to represent two personas. 
            The personas were designed from data in our user surveys and based on the communityâ€™s demographic data.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">Structure</h3>
        <p class="text_section">Our team knew we wanted to have an app that can be easily navigated and accessed. We created a structure that reselmbled a Tinder approach. 
            Students would be able to view others and a short bio description of the person before deciding to befriend them.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="text_section">Visualizing the User Experience</h1>
        <h3 class="text_section">Wireframe/Sketches</h3>
        <p class="text_section">As the UI/UX Designer of the app, I performed various rapid sketches to get an idea of the preferred layouts of the team. 
            This exercise allowed me to discover what components were essential to the app and what can be discarded. It also helped me identify the passage users 
            would take to navigate the app.</p>
        <h3 class="text_section">Low Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <img src="images/lowfluffle.png" alt="fluffle app prototype">
        <h3 class="text_section">High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <img src="images/highfluffle.png" alt="fluffle app prototype">
        <h3 class="text_section">Improvements</h3>
        <p class="text_section">Given more time, we would have loved to hold interviews and do more research to gain a deeper understanding of the issue. 
            Additionally, we would have loved to go through multiple iterations and apply user feedback onto our prototype. We would have loved to expand this idea to 
            be used and incorporated all throughout the UC system.</p>
